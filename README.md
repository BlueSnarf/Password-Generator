This is a basic password generator that uses python to randomly select a combination of any digit, letter, or symbol on the standard QWERTY keyboard. 

You can select the length of the password as high as you want, and you can generate as many passwords as you want as well

It's not included in the code, but you can use the Tabulate directory to organize these in a nice table ("pip install tabulate" and then "from tabulate import tabulate")
