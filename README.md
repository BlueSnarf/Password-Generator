This is a basic password generator that uses python to randomly select a combination of any digit, letter, or symbol on the standard QWERTY keyboard. 

You can select the length of the password as high as you want, and you can generate as many passwords as you want as well

you should also use the pip install function to install both Tabulate (to make it nice and organized) and Random (to generate a random string of characters)


Example output with 1 password at a length of 20:

Here is your password

+I!(Jk-ZP+Ut@Z&00dIe
